Folder structure - split projects - ms test

I've added two extension methods on the string class: - IsValid and IsOneLetterDifferent. Normally I'd consider it somewhat dangerous to extend a basic data type such as string, but in this case it does help with code readability.

Assumptions
Input/Dictionary words are only valid if: -
* They are 4 characters are ignored
* They only contain alpha (a-z) characters
